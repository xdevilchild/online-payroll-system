# Payroll-Management
Full Stack Payroll Management System for admins using mysql and php.

# Overview:
Payroll consists of the process by which a business pays its employees for work performed during a specific period. A payroll system allows businesses to follow a set series of processes in order to make timely, correct payments in compliance with government regulations.
The payroll process typically includes calculating employee pay, recording payroll transactions. A company must have in place a timekeeping system that accurately reflects the hours and number of days put in by employees as well as the regular salary payments for exempt workers. Companies also must withhold Social Security and Medicare contributions from employees' salary and pay a matching amount.
